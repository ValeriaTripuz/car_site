      <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how car-import uses cookies and similar
        technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at icebereg.com
        ("Website"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use
        them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or
        that becomes personal information if we combine it with other
        information.
      </p>
      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
        device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website
        owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
        efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, car-import?? ) are
        called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the
        website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies
        enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or
        through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and
        analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize
        your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when
        it visits certain other websites.
      </p>
      <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        We use first- and third- party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies
        are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate,
        and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
        Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our
        users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties
        serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other
        purposes. This is described in more detail below.
      </p>
      <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
        can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
        Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select
        which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies
        cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and
        on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
        website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
        website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser
        controls to accept or refuse cookies.
